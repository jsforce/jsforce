# Migrating `jsforce` from v2 to v3

## Drop support for old node and browsers
jsforce v3 only supports node >= 18 and modern browsers (see our browserlist config for more info: https://browsersl.ist/#q=last+2+versions%2C+not+dead%2C+%3E+0.2%25).

## Node-specific build

The `jsforce` package is intended to work on browsers and node, as such it needs to include multiple builds which increas its final size.
If your project runs on node you can use `@jsforce/jsforce-node` to reduce your bundle size, see [JSFORCE-NODE.md](./JSFORCE-NODE.md) for more info.

## Removed deprecated `JwtOAuth2` class

This class was added in jsforce v2 to support the JWT Oauth flow, then deprecated in favor of allowing specifying the `grant_type` in `Connection.authorize` and the OAuth module. For more info:

https://github.com/jsforce/jsforce/pull/1332

## Retry on network errors

All HTTP requests are now retried on network errors like `ECONNRESET`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `ETIMEDOUT`, etc.
If you had a wrapper around jsforce to retry on these you can remove them.

## Error handling

When the Salesforce REST API returns multiple errors, a `MULTIPLE_API_ERRORS` error will be thrown.
Full error details can be accessed in the `error.data` property.

jsforce < v3 used to pick the first error only and ignore others.

Example: inserting an `Account` record fails because of two validation rules errors
```typescript
try {
  await conn.sobject('Account').insert({
    Name: 'ACME',
    Phone: '123',
  })
} catch(error) {
  if (error.errorCode === 'MULTIPLE_API_ERRORS') {
    console.log(error.data)
  }
}
```
```
[
  {
    message: "no 'ACME' accounts",
    errorCode: 'FIELD_CUSTOM_VALIDATION_EXCEPTION',
    fields: []
  },
  {
    message: "no '123' phone",
    errorCode: 'FIELD_CUSTOM_VALIDATION_EXCEPTION',
    fields: []
  }
]
```

## Bulk API

`Bulk.query` returns a promise that resolves to a record stream instead (instead of just returning the stream).

`Batch.poll` emits `inProgress` event instead of `progress` when checking the its status. Payload stays the same.

`Batch.poll` emits `error` event and throws if batch state = `Failed`.
In v1 it only emitted the `error` event which made it easy to miss the server error message unless you subscribed to that event.

## Bulk V2 API

Code was moved to its own `bulk2` file, if you were importing it like this:

```
import { IngestJobV2 } from 'jsforce/lib/api/bulk.js';
```

you should change it to:

```
import { IngestJobV2 } from 'jsforce/lib/api/bulk2.js';
```

`QueryJobV2.poll` and `IngestJobV2.poll` emit `error` event and throws if job state = `Failed`.
In v2 it only emitted the `error` event which made it easy to miss the server error message unless you subscribed to that event.

`Bulk2.job` now allows to get an existing query or ingest job by ID by specifing the type of job (`query` or `ingest`) as the first arg.

Before:
```typescript
const ingestJob = bulk2.job({ id: jobId });
```

After:
```typescript
const queryJob = bulk2.job('query', { id: jobId });

const ingestJob = bulk2.job('ingest', { id: jobId });
```

### Bulk V2 query - streaming API

The following changes were made to the Bulk V2 query module to solve memory-related issues when working with a big amount of records, specifically when paginating over results and having to keep them in memory. The Bulk (V1) module was already doing this so it should also help if you want migrate to Bulk V2 API.

* `Bulk2.query` returns a promise that resolves to a record stream instead of the array of records.

Here's an example of how to use a record stream to collect all records by listening to the `record` event:
```typescript
let records = [];
const recordStream = await conn.bulk2.query(`SELECT Id, Name FROM Account`)

recordStream
  .on('record', (data) => {
    records = records.concat(data);
  })

console.log(records)
```


* `QueryJob.getResults` method was removed in favor of `QueryJob.result`.
This method would fetch records from the query job and return them, causing your program to run out of memory very quickly on millon of records.
`QueryJob.result` returns a record stream which allows to stream records to any source, see the example above.
